#  My Personal Journey
**Learning Git, GitHub and Markdown**

> This repository is mainly intended to play around and get comfortable with the aforementioned  concepts


## Tools

1. Git - Should be obvious, my main intention  is  to comfortable using this on the BASH CLI
2. Remote Git (GitHub) - This is where the test repository is placed, I will see later if using another remote provider makes more sense
3. Markdown - Main objective here is to get comfortable with the language, so I will intuitively use it to take notes
    - ReText is my chosen Editor used on the Debian desktop. Seems simple enough and provides a WYSIWYG interface
    -  Stackedit.io will be used as a web-based editor, whenever  I  am on a computer I don't control
    -  Markor is the Editor utilized on my mobile devices (one often needs to take notes on the field)

###  Next Steps for Tools

1. Test stackedit.io on several devices
2. Create an GitHub account
3. Link stackedit.io and GitHub
4. Link my local git folder with github

## Content

**A _"subject to change"_ list of things I want to store**

- My notes regarding the usage of my  Linux system, especially long bash commands and short scripts
-  My notes regarding PC games - As I'm often interrupted I take notes  on where I am and what I want to do next. 

    *Those are not tutorials or walkthroughs and will most likely not useful to anyone but me*

- My hardware evaluation / comparison lists - Just to list what I consider to buy and have the main pro / cons for me   

Please continue on the [Index](index.md) file,  to see if those *pipe dreams* came through.
