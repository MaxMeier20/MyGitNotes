# My Firefox Setup

## Addons Install
- [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)
- [I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/)
- [Startpage Private Search](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/startpage-private-search/?src=search)
- [uBlockOrigin](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- (*optional*) [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/umatrix/?src=search)*

\* *The uMatrix extension is powerful but needs to be adapted for many sites to display correctly - This only makes sense on daily driver machines, that are extensively used

# My Opera Setup

## Video Playback Issue

As Opera doesn't play .h264 video, the problem is easily solved by replacing `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opera/libffmpeg.so `with a fully licensed version of the library - either included in Google Chrome / Chromium and in many commmercial games from steam
