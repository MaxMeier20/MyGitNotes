# Free Mail Provider Selection

*Most of my mail addresses which have been built on free services are defunct in 2020 - This is thought to select some new providers, so I can continue to receive mail, while not getting my "real" accounts more cluttered than they already are*

This is for sending / receiving mails and keeping them. For one of activities I use services like [10 Minute Mail](https://10minemail.com/de/) or  [Mailinator](https://www.mailinator.com/v3/#/#inboxpane)

## Exclusion List

- **Apple / iCloud** no, just simply no
- **Google** apart from being a privacy nightmare,  I have some nice working accounts which collect newsletters fo specific topics already
-  **Microsoft** this could interfere with the mandatory O365  login I need to keep with work
-   **United Internet** (GMX/Web.de etc.) could interfere with my real accounts 
-   **Yahoo** they deleted three perfectly fine working addresses and rolled them in with my main account - If I get status updates on the puppet addresses those apparently go into the digital void

## Criteria

- Mails and the addresses themselves shouldn't expire
- Should be reasonably large, so the mails  from there aren't categorized as spam all the time 
- Storage size is not a huge consideration, but it should be provide enough to store a few mails *(I'm looking at the  15MB I had at web.de in the past)*
- Has to be accessible via a web interface from everywhere
            to be extended

## Providers
*This will start as a selection of names with c&p web comments - at the end I will decide on the tracked criteria*
