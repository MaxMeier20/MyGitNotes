# MyGitNotes
Just my personal notebook in Markdown, to get comfortable with git/github

This is a little bit different than a normal repository, as it contains a "website".The flow is:

##### Development Branch (sends pull request to) **➦** master (even if authorative copy, sends pull request to) **➦** gh-pages (webversion)

*basically for simple edits "master" ist the development branch and "gh-pages" equals a master branch*
