# MyGitNotes
Just my personal notebook in Markdown, to get comfortable with [git](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.de.html)/github and [github pages](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

----

This is a little bit different than a normal repository, as it contains a "website".The flow is:

##### development branch (sends pull request to) **➦** master (even if authorative copy, sends pull request to) **➦** gh-pages (webversion)
base:master - compare:development **-** base:gh-pages - compare:master

*basically for simple edits "master" ist the development branch and "gh-pages" equals a master branch*
